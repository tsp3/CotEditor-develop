<h1>Are there any known issues?</h1>

<p>There are some known issues as listed below. These should be taken care of in the future releases, but solutions to them are not yet in sight.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When Line Spacing is set bigger than 0, the underlines, that Japanese input methods show during Kana-Kanji conversion, are displayed lower than usual.</li>
	<li>When “Fix line height with composite font” is turned on, white lines may appear between the lines inside the selection (i.e. the background-color can be seen through).</li>
	<li>If you selected Cancel in the authentication window of “authopen” when saving, error logs are output to console. (“authopen” is the name of a helper application which is launched by CotEditor.)</li>
</ul>
